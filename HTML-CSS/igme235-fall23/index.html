            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am a second year Game Design and Development major at RIT. I hope that taking this class will expand my work opprotunities. I think that taking an front-end HTML co-op is something that I would be able to decently well.
                While I'm not in class, I like to play video games, of course. I hope that I can learn more about creating fun gameplay systems and asset creation to further development on my personal game project that I hope to release someday.
                Outside of video games, I also enjoy writing! I particularly like writing poetry as I'm taking a class on it this year. By the time I graduate, I hope to have the skills necessary to develop my aforementioned personal project, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VnDD_LYsFKewBteXfFNdP0jkYeTHlJSzbtUXYOTov_M/edit">Shinsheki</a>, a JRPG in a similar vain to the Persona series.

                <p>Here's a poem for you while you're here...</p>
                <div id="poem">
                    <blockquote>
                        “What are your favorite things in a poem? - And only write in a poem form.” <br>
                        An interesting proposition <br>
                        I truly enjoy poems with ambiguity <br>
                        That you question the everyday <br>
                        Whether that be society&#39;s notions on the norm <br>
                        Or something that makes you perceive your own reality differently <br>
                        Can	&#39;t forget the words <br>
                        Oh, glorious words! <br>
                        Each one brimming with a new possibility <br>
                        A new tool in my repertoire <br>
                        To strike against my internal iron <br>
                        Hopefully forging a new definition of the self <br>
                        Examining the forms are also such a fun time <br>
                        Why did the author choose to repeat this, group that? <br>
                        Uncovering the meaning of a poem is the ultimate puzzle <br>
                        And the best part? <br>
                        Your unique interpretation being your answer <br>
                        The key that unlocks new discourse and connections <br>
                        So when I was asked <br>
                        “What are your favorite things in a poem? - And only write in a poem form.” <br>
                        I think I did a damn good job. <br>
